            Closures are confusing because they are an “invisible” concept.<br>
            <br> When you use an object, a variable, or a function, you do this intentionally. You think: “I’m gonna need a variable here,” and add it to your code. <br> <br>Closures are different. By the time most people approach closures, they have
            already used them unknowingly many times — and it is likely that this is true for yourself, too. So learning closures is less about understanding a new concept and more about recognizing something you have already been doing for a while.
        </p><br><br>
        <h3>tl;dr</h3><br><br>
        <p>You have a closure when
            <strong> function accesses variables defined outside of it.</strong> <br> <br>For example, this code snippet contains a closure
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5 style="color:rgb(85, 122, 231) ; ">Notice how user => user.startsWith(query) </h5><br> <br>Using a function gives us the ultimate flexibility because we can run this function any number of times, at any time — and from anywhere in our program. <br> <br>
        </p>
        <hr> <br>
        <p> <strong> You can stop reading here, if you want.</strong> The rest of this article approaches closures in a different way. Instead of explaining what a closure is, it will walk you through the process of discovering closures — like the first programmers
            did in the 1960s. <br> <br>
            <hr> <br> <br>
            <h3>Step 1: Functions Can Access Outside Variables</h3> <br> <br>This code works! But look closer. Notice the eat function is inside the liveADay function. Is that even allowed? Can we really put a function inside another function?
            <br> There are languages in which a code structured this way is not valid. For example, this code is not valid in the C language (which doesn’t have closures). This means that in C, our second conclusion isn’t true — we can’t just take some
            arbitrary piece of code and wrap it in a function. But JavaScript doesn’t suffer from that limitation.</p>
